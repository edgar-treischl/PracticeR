Practice R is a textbook for the social sciences and contains several online tutorials based on the `learnr` package. The corresponding package `PracticeR` gives access to the tutorials of the book and provides further materials and templates to learn R.

## Installation

You can install a preview version of PracticeR from my github account:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("edgar-treischl/PracticeR")
```

## Example

The book is expected for 2022, at the moment there is only one `preview` tutorial available. To load a specific tutorial, insert the corresponding name in the `practice` function, which calls the `learnr` package in the background and hands over the tutorial from Practice R.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(PracticeR)
## basic example code
practice("preview")
```

If everything works, the tutorial will be opened in R Studio or your browser:
